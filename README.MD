## üéÆ About the Game

**Too Hot To Run** is an endless runner where survival is not just about dodging obstacles.  
You control **Bob**, a character who is constantly heating up!  
Your objective is to last as long as possible by:

- Navigating a dangerous track  
- Avoiding barriers  
- Managing Bob‚Äôs internal temperature  

Power-ups can help you‚Äîbut each comes with its own trade-offs. How long can you survive before overheating, crashing, or freezing in place?

## üïπÔ∏è How to Play

### Objective
Survive for as long as possible to achieve the highest score. Avoid obstacles and carefully manage Bob‚Äôs temperature.

### Core Mechanics
- **Temperature:** If Bob‚Äôs temperature exceeds **50¬∞C**, the game ends.  
- **Obstacles:** Collisions with barriers, lamps, or other objects result in instant failure.  
- **Keep Moving:** If Bob‚Äôs speed drops to zero, he explodes.  

### Power-Ups
- üî• **Fire Bonus:** Boosts speed and acceleration but quickly increases Bob‚Äôs temperature.  
- ‚ùÑÔ∏è **Ice Bonus:** Lowers Bob‚Äôs temperature but reduces speed and acceleration. Use carefully to avoid stalling.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Technical Features

This project demonstrates key computer graphics concepts:

- **Model Loading**: Uses *Assimp* to import character and environment models.  
- **Instanced Rendering**: Efficiently renders the world and obstacles with fewer draw calls.  
- **Multiple Light Sources**: Includes point lights and a directional light for a dynamic scene.  
- **Particle System**: Provides smoke effects.  
- **Scene Management**: Implements a state machine for menus and game logic.  
- **Text Rendering**: Uses *FreeType* for UI elements (e.g., FPS counter).  
- **Sound Management**: Adds background music and sound effects.
